# Java File Transfer Application

This application consists of a client-server system built in Java for transferring files.

## Description

The system has a server part and a client part. The client can send files of various types (text, images, etc.) to the server. The server receives these files and displays them on a graphical user interface. The server can also download the received files.

The server listens for client connections on a specific port. When a client connects, the server reads the incoming file's name and content from the client's input stream.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Running the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `Server.java` to start the server
3. Run `Client.java` to start the client
